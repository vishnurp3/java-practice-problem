Subject: Clarification on Performance Review and Hike Percentage

Hi [Manager 1] and [Manager 2],

I hope youâ€™re doing well.

I wanted to seek clarification regarding my appraisal this year. Based on my performance review discussion, I received 3 points in two categories and 2 points in one category. At no point during the conversation did I get the impression that my performance warranted a 0% hike.

However, after the recent meeting with [Senior Leader], I learned that [Percentage]% of employees were satisfied with their hikes and that the hike percentage was based on individual performance. This has left me quite confused, as I would like to understand where I fell short.

Was there any negative feedback from the team leads or managers that contributed to this decision? (During the meeting, [Senior Leader] mentioned that the hike was based on discussions among various people, so I wanted to check if there was any specific feedback that impacted my appraisal.) I would appreciate any insights on areas where I need to improve. I would also like to have an open conversation about this, as understanding the rationale behind this decision is important for me to grow and align better with expectations.

Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
